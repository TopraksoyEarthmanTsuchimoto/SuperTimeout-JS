# SuperTimeout-JS
Ever wished you could pause and unpause the ticking of all `setTimeout`s and `setInterval`s in your app?

With this javascript library you can replace them with `SuperTimeout`s and `SuperInterval`s and do just that.

## Examples
[See a demo of SuperTimeout, the pausable version of setTimeout](https://topraksoyearthmantsuchimoto.github.io/SuperTimeout-JS/)

[See a demo of SuperInterval, the pausable version of setInterval](https://topraksoyearthmantsuchimoto.github.io/SuperTimeout-JS/index2.html)
